    <td colspan=2 class="greenbox bigtext" >Computer Device Production
        <p class="smalltext">The manufacturing, shipping, usage, and disposal of computers consume a lot of energy that is usually generated from burning fossil fuels. This greatly contributes to the global warming crisis as huge amounts of greenhouse gases are released. Burning of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and the production of computers directly play a hand in it. Inside these devices are precious materials and are often found through unjust labor. The refinement of these materials is also often extremely expensive and energy-intensive. They are also usually just disposed of in landfills when they can easily be recycled and reused.

     <td colspan=2 class="whitebox bigtext"> Raw Materials
          <p class="smalltext">Raw materials are first extracted from the Earth through mining. Most types of mining are not ethical for the Earth as they strip large amounts of habitat from the nearby ecosystems. A single computer alone requires over 30 different materials that are non-renewable so long-term plans to continue computer production with this same process are not sustainable. Once they've been mined out they have to be manufactured for them to be usable and this is done through a very intensive process. These materials are shipped throughout the whole world adding to the energy costs of transportation on top of everything else previous to this step.

    <td colspan=2 class="greenbox bigtext">Computer Device Usage
        <p class="smalltext"> Every gigabit of data that is transmitted online consumes a lot of energy. This single-handedly creates a lot of greenhouse gas emissions because of the high demand for energy production. It’s required for when a device is charging and to run operating servers, networks, and data centers. The equipment needed for these networks also has to be maintained, upgraded as technology progresses, or disposed of. This means that even more material, energy, and labor are needed just to keep our usage of the internet working properly. This process of manufacturing, transporting, installing, operating, upgrading, and disposing leads to a critical issue that going under the radar and unnoticed by most people.

     <td colspan=2 class="whitebox bigtext"> Ewaste
          <p class="smalltext">Ewaste is any waste that comes from computer devices and it also contains harsh and harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and cadmium. These chemicals can run off into our soils and waters then affect everything that depends on them, including us. They harm human health as they damage our kidneys, cause neurological deformities, and birth deformities if we are exposed to them for too long. E-waste is toxic and non-biodegradable that continues to build up in our environment if we don't do anything about it.

    <td colspan=2 class="greenbox bigtext" >Computer Device Disposal
        <p class="smalltext">The Diposal of computer devices often creates a fast-growing pollute called Ewate. 17.4% of electronic waste contains a mixture of harmful substances found in our waste which goes to landfills that directly contaminate our land and water. We produce over 62 billion kg of e-waste every year with very little parts of it being recycled and properly handled. Our current practices for disposing of E-waste can release toxic materials that leach onto the environment, degrading it over time. Our improper handling of e-waste has caused a huge loss in scarce and valuable materials as well as poisoning the planet that we live on. This has also been a huge contributor to litter worldwide as landfills are being filled to the brim with e-waste.

     <td colspan=2 class="whitebox bigtext"> Overflowing Landfills
          <p class="smalltext">Landfills are overflowing with trash with 20% of that coming from our computer usage, disposal, and production alone. This is an imidate issue as when landfills run out of space then the trash and chemicals will leak out into our waters, affecting not only the marine life but us as well. With Ewaste being extremely toxic it can kill off entire ecosystems if it’s concentrated enough. They are also one of the prominent contributors to methane gas emissions as it takes so long for it to decompose which means that they are constantly releasing methane into the atmosphere.
