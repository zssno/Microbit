        <p class="smalltext">The best way to reduce the environmental impact of computer device production on the environment is to reduce the usage of harmful components in the devices. We as a society have already grown accustomed to computers so the best way of solving this issue is to change and adapt. We must design computers that contain fewer of these harmful components, which harm not only us but also the environment. Computer devices should also be designed to last long so that demand for more production decreases and therefore the environmental consequences as well. Manufacturers should also reuse parts of the computer that are valuable and scarce so that they can make their carbon footprint smaller. Buying second-hand is also a good way of saving valuable parts and materials.

        <p class="smalltext">Try to limit the amount of time you spend on the internet and be mindful of the impacts you may be making. You can also start by making small changes to your computer usage such as avoiding unnecessary emails and attachments, reducing the amount of things you're printing, and using built-in power-saving features to reduce your energy consumption. Shutting down your computer at the end of the day can also help save and conserve energy. Overall the best way to reduce this impact is to be smart when using the internet and doing anything unnecessary can be a huge contributor to e-waste. </p>

    <td colspan=2 class="greenbox bigtext " >Computer Device Disposal
        <p class="smalltext">Make sure you know the lifespan of your computer before purchasing it so that you make sure you get a good computer and so you won't have to buy another one later on. You can also keep a computer for longer than you think if you have a decent computer that can handle what you want from it then there is no need to upgrade. If your computer isn't older than 7 years then you can simply change out certain components of the computer instead of buying a whole new one to reduce your impact on the environment. Instead of buying brand new you also also buy second-hand or a refurbished one as they can work just as well as a brand new computer.
